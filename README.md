# ES32_Wireless_MIDI_Controller
This ESP32 program is created in the Arduino IDE. It receives digital switch signals from
normally open switches, and sends corresponding MIDI notes wirelessly to a compatible sound
generating device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). In this example, the controller is named, 
"BGController", but the programmer is free to name the controller anything they like.
